# Formative 2 - SafeBoda - Authentication & Security

# Scenario Overview

SafeBoda Rwanda has successfully launched its MVP and attracted  $500+$  early users in Kigali. However, the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) has requested enhanced security measures and data protection compliance before approving nationwide expansion.

As the security-focused developer on the team, you must implement comprehensive authentication systems that comply with Rwanda's emerging data protection regulations while maintaining an excellent user experience.
